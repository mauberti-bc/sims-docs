# Surveys

Surveys represent distinct events during which you collected data, often reflecting true ecological surveys.

After creating a Project, you can create a Survey. Surveys have metadata that gives important context to the data they contain. For example, Survey metadata describes your focal species, parts of your sampling strategy, and who was involved

This page defines the attributes that a Survey can have. We recommend reading about each attribute, even if its definition seems obvious, to better understand how Surveys are structured.

The [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/create-surveys) section provides an introduction to managing Surveys.

##### Survey ID

> A unique ID that identifies a Survey

Every Survey is automatically assigned a unique Survey ID. Survey IDs are positive integers.

You can find a Survey's ID in the browser URL when viewing that Survey. For example, https://sims.nrs.gov.bc.ca/admin/projects/1/surveys/2/details is Survey ID 2.

#### Example

3

---

##### Name

> A descriptive label that identifies a Survey and alludes to its purpose, region, and time period

Every Survey has a unique name that distinguishes it from other Surveys. You should give your Surveys concise yet informative names. Although the Project name should already contain information about the target species and region, we recommend including this information in a Survey's name to help Surveys be standalone.

#### Example

Fernie Grizzly Bear Population Monitoring 2021 Count

---

##### Type

> A set of categories describing the nature of your work

Types are labels that help you organize your Surveys and help others discover Surveys of interest. They aim to distinguish the different types of ecological work, such as research, monitoring, and salvage.

#### Example

Habitat Restoration & Enhancement, Salvage, and Monitoring

---

##### Start Date

> The date when your Survey began

A Survey's Start Date should be precise. You can include travel days and planning time to determine your Start Date, depending on the nature of your Survey.

#### Example

January 3, 2022

---

##### End Date

> The date when your Survey ended

A Survey's End Date should be precise. You can include travel days and planning time to determine your End Date, depending on the nature of your Survey.

#### Example

March 20, 2023

---

##### Primary Species of Interest

> Target species that you surveying for

This field is used to help you and others find and interpret relevant Surveys. If you were interested in numerous species, you can select each species separately or select the lowest-ranking taxonomic group that includes your target species.

It is assumed that you have reported all observations of your Primary Species of Interest.

#### Example

Black bear (_Ursus americanus_)

---

##### Secondary Species of Interest

> Species that are relevant but not the focus of your work

This is an optional field that allows you to enter species that are relevant but that you are not surveying for. If you were interested in numerous species, you can select each species separately or select the lowest-ranking taxonomic group that includes your target species.

#### Example

Grizzly bear (_Ursus arctos_)

---

##### Permits

> Permits that allowed you to collect data or otherwise do your Survey

Permitting agencies may use this field to confirm that data has been submitted where it is mandatory.

#### Example

8361637

---

##### Purpose

> A brief summary about what you intend to estimate or measure

The Purpose should include one or two sentences describing why exactly you did the Survey and what your expected outcomes are. A Survey's Purpose is often more tangible than its Project's objectives.

#### Example

2021 count of grizzly bears in and around Fernie to estimate the population growth rate

---

##### Ecological Variables

> Ecological dynamics and phenomena that are relevant to your work

This field helps you organize Surveys that focus on different ecological processes, such as Birth Rates or Recruitment, Species Distributions, and Species Density. This field also helps others find relevant Surveys.

#### Example

Birth Rates or Recruitment

---

##### Survey Participants

> People who contributed to your Survey, either as a biologist or in a supporting role

Adding colleagues as Survey Participants allows for users to easily find Surveys that they contributed to. When you add a Survey Participant, you must also add a Job Title to specify how they contributed. Job Titles include Lead Biologist, Biologist, and Pilot, among other options.

#### Example

Jane Doe, Biologist
