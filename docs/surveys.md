# Surveys

Surveys represent distinct events during which you collected data, often reflecting true ecological surveys. We recommend reading [Create Surveys](/docs/getting-started/create-projects) in the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) section before reading about the exact information in a Survey.

To start managing data in the Species Inventory Management System, you upload it to a Survey. A Survey's details give important context to the data it contains by describing your focal species, parts of your sampling strategy, and who participated.

This page defines the attributes that a Survey can have. We recommend reading about each attribute, even if its definition seems obvious, to better understand how to create informative Surveys.

We suggest reading all of the [Getting Started]() section for an introduction to managing data in the Species Inventory Management System.

##### Survey ID

> A unique ID that identifies a Survey

Every Survey is automatically assigned a unique Survey ID. Survey IDs are positive integers. You can find a Survey's ID in the browser URL when viewing that Survey. For example, _sims.nrs.gov.bc.ca/admin/projects/1/surveys/2/details_ is Survey ID 1.

#### Example

3

##### Name

> A descriptive label that identifies a Survey and alludes to its purpose, region, and time period

Every Survey has a unique name that distinguishes it from other Surveys. You should give your Surveys concise yet informative names. Although the Project name should already contain information about the target species and region, we recommend including this information in a Survey's name to help Surveys be standalone.

#### Example

Fernie Grizzly Bear Population Monitoring 2021 Count

---

##### Purpose

> A brief summary about what you intend to estimate or measure

The Purpose should include one or two sentences describing why exactly you did the Survey and your expected outcomes. A Survey's Purpose is often more tangible than its Project's objectives.

#### Example

2021 count of grizzly bears in and around Fernie to estimate the population growth rate

---

##### Program

> The general business area of your work: Fish, Wildlife, or Other

Program information is used to organize Projects in a way that makes them easy to search and discover. Assigning Projects to the Fish and/or Wildlife programs helps relevant teams find your work.

#### Example

Wildlife

##### Start Date

> The date when your Project began

A Project's Start Date can be approximate, but it should occur in the correct fiscal year when you initiated your Project.

#### Example

January 3, 2022

---

##### End Date

> The date when your Project ended

A Project's End Date can be approximate and may be left blank if the Project is ongoing. As collaborative workspaces, Projects are not expected to have end dates in the same way that [Surveys]() do.

#### Example

March 20, 2023

---

##### Members

> Users who have been granted access to the Project

Project Members can view all information in a Project. A person must gain access to the system before they can be invited to a Project.

#### Example

John Doe

---

##### Roles

> Titles assigned to Project Members that determine their permissions in the Project

Available roles are Coordinator, Collaborator, and Observer. Coordinators can upload and edit data, manage the members of a Project, and even delete the Project. Collaborators can add and edit data but cannot manage the list of Project members nor delete the Project. Observers can only view data.

#### Example

Coordinator
