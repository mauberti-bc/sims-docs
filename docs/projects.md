# Projects

Projects are collaborative workspaces for co-managing data from ecological surveys.

When you create a Project, you and your team are responsible for managing the information in that Project. As you adjust the expected outcomes and objectives of your work, you should update your Project's details to include the latest, most accurate information. Outdated or misleading information might confuse people who want to build upon your work.

This page defines the attributes that a Project can have. We suggest reading about each attribute, even if its definition seems obvious, to better understand how Projects are structured.

{: .note }

The [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/create-projects) section provides an introduction to managing Projects.

##### Project ID

> A unique ID that identifies a Project

Every Project is automatically assigned a unique Project ID. Project IDs are positive integers.

You can find a Project's ID in the browser URL when viewing that Project. For example, https://sims.nrs.gov.bc.ca/admin/projects/1/details is Project ID 1.

#### Example

7

---

##### Name

> A descriptive label that identifies a Project and alludes to its objectives

Every Project has a unique name that distinguishes it from other Projects. You should give your Projects concise yet informative names. We recommend including the species, region, and other keywords in the name.

#### Example

Fernie Grizzly Bear Population Monitoring

---

##### Objectives

> A brief summary about what you intend to achieve in your Project

Objectives should include one or two sentences describing your expected outcomes and goals.

#### Example

Estimate the number of grizzly bears in and around Fernie annually to support human-wildlife conflict mitigation

---

##### Program

> The general business area of your work: Fish, Wildlife, or Other

Program information is used to organize Projects in a way that makes them easy to search and discover. Assigning Projects to the Fish and/or Wildlife programs helps relevant teams find your work.

#### Example

Wildlife

##### Start Date

> The date when your Project began

A Project's Start Date can be approximate, but it should occur in the correct fiscal year when you initiated your Project.

#### Example

January 3, 2022

---

##### End Date

> The date when your Project ended

A Project's End Date can be approximate and may be left blank if the Project is ongoing. As collaborative workspaces, Projects are not expected to have end dates in the same way that [Surveys](/docs/surveys) do.

#### Example

March 20, 2023

---

##### Members

> Users who have been granted access to the Project

Project Members can view all information in a Project. A person must gain access to the system before they can be a Project member.

#### Example

John Doe

---

##### Project Roles

> Titles assigned to Project Members that determine their permissions in the Project

Available Project Roles are Coordinator, Collaborator, and Observer.

- Coordinators can upload and edit data, manage the members of a Project, and even delete the Project.
- Collaborators can add and edit data but cannot manage the list of Project members nor delete the Project.
- Observers can only view data.

#### Example
