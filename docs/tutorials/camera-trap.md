# Uploading Camera Trap Data

### Scenario

In this scenario, we are uploading data describing the size of the marmot population in Strathcona Provincial Park. We collected this data using camera traps between January 1st and October 31st, 2021.

### Create a Project

We'll start by creating a new Project because we don't yet have a Project about marmot population sizes in Strathcona Provincial Park. We'll give this Project a descriptive name: Strathcona Provincial Park Marmot Population Monitoring. We'll also describe the objectives of this work: Estimate the number of marmots in Strathcona Provincial Park to compare to earlier baseline estimates and support population recovery efforts.

This work was done in collaboration with Jane Doe. Jane is interested in co-managing these data, so I will invite Jane to my Project as a Coordinator.

### Creating a Survey

Next, let's create a Survey in our newly made Project to upload our actual data and sampling information.

We'll give our Survey a descriptive name, as we did for the Project, that alludes to why we did the Survey: Strathcona Provincial Park Marmot Population 2021 Count. This name seems a bit redundant with the Project's name, but this will help the Survey be shared as a standalone dataset. If we just said "2021 Count", our colleagues wouldn't immediately know what we counted.

### Add Sampling Information

We've already entered our Survey Area, but we haven't entered the more precise locations of our camera traps.
