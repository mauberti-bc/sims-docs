# Add Animals

You can add Marked or Known Animals to your Survey to manage data about individuals that you have captured, measured, or are monitoring over time. You should think of this process as creating a profile for an individual animal that you can reference in various contexts, including Species Observations.

### Animals receive unique identifiers

When you add a new Marked or Known Animal to your Survey, you'll give it an Alias that can be used to easily reference that individual across Surveys. You can think of an Alias as a unique username, like `@MOOSE18`.

Behind the scenes, there is a more robust identifer that the system uses to identify individuals: Critter ID. A Critter ID is a long sequence of letters and numbers that will never change, unlike an Alias which can be updated.

You should add a new Marked or Known Animal for every unique individual that you have captured, marked, measured, or confirmed the mortality of.

### Animal attributes are species-dependent

An animal can have a variety of attributes, including information about:

- Captures
- Mortality
- Ecological units
- Measurements
- Markings
- Family relationships

Information about ecological units, measurements, and markings is species-dependent. This means that you can't enter the wing length of a bear, the paw width of a bird, or other puzzling information.

If you don't see an ecological unit or measurement that you want to add, please [contact us](). System administrators manage the list of species-dependent attributes and can easily add new options.

### Integrating Wildlife Health IDs

We are collaborating with wildlife health biologists to let you reference Marked or Known Animals by their Wildlife Health ID, which is the identifier used in the BC Wildlife Health Program.
