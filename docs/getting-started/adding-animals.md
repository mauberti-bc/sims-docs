# Add Animals

You can add Marked or Known Animals to your Survey to manage data about individuals that you have captured, measured, or need to monitor over time.

### Animals receive unique identifiers

When you add a new Marked or Known Animal to your Survey, you can create an Alias to easily reference that animal across different Surveys. You should think of an Alias as a unique username, like `@CARIBOU18`.

Behind the scenes, there is a more robust identifer that the system uses to identify individuals: Critter ID. Critter IDs are long sequences of letters and numbers that never change, unlike Aliases which you can update.

{: .note }

You should add a new Marked or Known Animal for every unique individual that you have captured, marked, measured, or confirmed the mortality of.

### Animal attribute are species-dependent

An animal can have a variety of attributes, including information about:

- Captures
- Mortalities
- Ecological units
- Measurements
- Markings
- Family relationships

Data about ecological units, measurements, and markings are species-dependent. This means that you can't enter the wing length of a bear, the front left paw width of a bird, or other puzzling information.

### Integrating Wildlife Health IDs

We are collaborating with wildlife health biologists to let you reference Marked or Known Animals by their Wildlife Health ID.
