# Add Telemetry Devices

You can add Telemetry Devices to [Marked or Known Animals](/docs/getting-started/add-animals) for the system to automatically retrieve data from your compatible GPS devices. This means that you do not need to manually submit GPS telemetry records and can manage telemetry data from the perspective of your animals, not just devices.

### BC Telemetry Warehouse

When you add a Telemetry Device, the Species Inventory Management System forwards the device information to the BC Telemetry Warehouse. The BC Telemetry Warehouse then automatically retrieves data from your devices daily, which you can view, interact with, and export through Species Inventory Management System.

At the end of your Telemetry Device's deployment, you can remove it from a Known or Marked Animal. This makes that Telemetry Device available to be added to a new Marked or Known Animal by any other user, in any Survey. While a Telemetry Device is deployed in the system, it cannot be added to another animal at the same time.

### Compatible devices

The BC Telemetry Warehouse works for most GPS devices from the following manufacturers:

- Vectronic
- Lotek

[You can manually add telemetry data from other devices]().

### Report mortalities

If a Known or Marked Animal has died, you should [report its mortality](), which involves entering the suspected mortality date, location, and other details.
