# Add Animals

You can add Marked or Known Animals to your Survey to manage data about individuals that you have captured, measured, or are monitoring over time.

### Animals receive unique identifiers

When you add a new Marked or Known Animal to your Survey, the system generates a unique identifier that can be used to reference that individual in Surveys. You can think of an animal's identifier as its username, like `@18-48371`.

{: .note }

You should add a new Marked or Known Animal for every unique individual that you have captured, marked, measured, or confirmed the mortality of.

### Animal attribute are species-dependent

An animal can have a variety of attributes, including information about:

- Captures
- Mortalities
- Ecological units
- Measurements
- Markings
- Family relationships

Data about ecological units (eg. the animal's metapopulation, population unit, herd), measurements, and markings are species-dependent. This means that you can't enter the wing length of a bear, the front left paw width of a bird, or other puzzling information.

### Integrating Wildlife Health IDs

We are collaborating with wildlife health biologists to let you reference Marked or Known Animals by their Wildlife Health ID. The system, however, does not use Wildlife Health IDs to identify individuals. The system instead identifies individuals by their Critter ID, which can never change, and treats the Wildlife Health ID as an attribute of an animal, similar to its species name. This allows you to add Marked or Known Animals with or without Wildlife Health IDs.
