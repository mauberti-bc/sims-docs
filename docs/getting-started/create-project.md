# Creating Projects

Projects are the starting point for uploading and co-managing ecological data.

## Your collaborative workspace

A Project is a collaborative workspace containing Surveys and members. You can think of Projects and Surveys like folders and subfolders, respectively. Projects are distinguished by their distinct objectives, such as monitoring a specific caribou herd or grizzly bear population over multiple years.

### Organize related Surveys

Projects don't directly store ecological data. Instead, they contain Surveys that _do_ store ecological data. All Surveys in a Project should contribute to that Project's objectives, as described in the Project metadata.

{: .note }

You should create a new Survey for every distinct ecological activity. However, whether you create a new Project or add to an existing Project is up to you, based on your interpretation of the data and your objectives.

### Project members

By default, the user who created a Project will be the only member of that Project. This means that whoever made the Project is the only person able to see its contents.

You can invite other members when editing Project metadata. You must sign up and gain access to SIMS before you can be invited to Projects.

### Project roles

When you invite someone to your Project, you must give them one of the follower roles:

- Coordinator
- Collaborator
- Observer

The Coordinator role is the most powerful. Coordinators can upload and edit data, manage the members of a Project, and even delete the Project. We recommend only assigning the Coordinator role to colleagues that you work directly with and trust.

The Collaborator role is the second most powerful. Collaborators can add and edit data, similar to Coordinators, but cannot manage Project members nor delete the Project.

The Observer role lets other users view data in your Project without the ability to edit or delete.
