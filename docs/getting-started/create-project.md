# Create Projects

Projects are the starting point for uploading and co-managing ecological data. All information in the Species Inventory Management System belongs to a Project.

### Your collaborative workspace

A Project is a collaborative workspace containing Surveys and members. You can think of Projects and Surveys like folders and subfolders, respectively, and members are people with access to those subfolders.

Projects are distinguished by their objectives. You should create a Project for every distinct set of objectives that you have, such as monitoring the size of a specific caribou herd or grizzly bear population over multiple years. However, you might need to create multiple Projects for related work if you have [nuanced rules around who can edit which data]().

### Organize related Surveys

Projects don't directly store ecological data. Instead, they contain Surveys that _do_ store ecological data. A Survey can only belong to one Project, but a Project can have multiple Surveys. All Surveys in a Project should contribute to that Project's objectives, as described in the Project metadata.

If the scope of your Project changes, you can always update your Project's objectives. You can also move Surveys between different Projects to restructure who your data are organized.

You should create a new Survey for every distinct ecological activity. The [Create Surveys]() page has more information about when and how to create a new Survey.

### Invite Project members

By default, the user who created a Project will be the only member of that Project. This means that whoever made the Project is the only person able to see its contents.

You can invite other members and specify their permissions using roles when editing the Project's metadata. Your colleagues must [sign up](/docs/getting-started/signing-up) for the Species Inventory Management System before they can be invited to Projects.

### Project roles

When you invite someone to your Project, you must give them one of the following roles:

- Coordinator
- Collaborator
- Observer

The Coordinator role is the most powerful. Coordinators can upload and edit data, manage the members of a Project, and even delete the Project. We recommend only assigning the Coordinator role to colleagues that you work directly with and trust.

The Collaborator role is the second most powerful. Collaborators can add and edit data, similar to Coordinators, but cannot manage Project members nor delete the Project.

The Observer role lets other users view data in your Project without the ability to edit or delete.
