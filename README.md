This site provides guidance and resources for using the Species Inventory Management System (SIMS).

SIMS is a web application for collaboratively managing ecological data in British Columbia. It is designed to support biologists by making it easy to manage and share information about ecological surveys, species observations, and individual animals being monitored through time.
